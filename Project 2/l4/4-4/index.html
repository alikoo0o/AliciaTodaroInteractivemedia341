   <p> <div class="text1"> The scientist on the radio said that humans will survive, and at first I was buoyed, but she meant only some of us, the ones living in tunnels, eating crickets to survive when the rest had died from mass starvation after droughts lasted longer and seas rose faster and wars killed bigger because everyone wanted what little was left.
        I'd be fine with being one of the billions dead unless you were still alive. Under a down comforter or by a trash fire,<div class="white">I want to be where you are. </div>  
        You know how poorly I dig holes, how angry I get when I'm cold, how twice I've accidentally maced myself, and still you'd take me with you down into earth, give me more than my fair share of caterpillar. 
        Few believe we're in the middle of the end because ruin can happen as slowly as plaque blocking arteries, and only later feels as true as your hand resting on my hip, both of us quiet as roses waiting for the bees to arrive.
