    I'd be fine with being one of the billions dead unless you were still alive. Under a down
    comforter or by a trash fire, I want to be where you are. 
    You know how poorly I dig holes, how angry I get when I'm cold, how twice I've accidentally
    maced myself, and still you'd take me with you down into earth, give me more than  </div>
  <div class="bt">  my fair 
    share of caterpillar.Few believe we're in the middle of the end because ruin can happen as slowly as plaque blocking
    arteries, and only later feels as true as your hand resting on my hip, both of us quiet as roses
    waiting for the bees to arrive.
