    The scientist on the radio said that humans will survive, and at first I was buoyed, but 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    she meant only some of us, the ones living in tunnels, eating crickets to survive when the
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
     rest had died from mass starvation after droughts lasted longer and seas rose faster and wars killed
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
      bigger because everyone wanted what little was left.

    I'd be fine with being one of the billions dead unless you were
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    still alive. Under a down comforter or by a trash fire, <em> I want to be where you are.</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You know how poorly I dig holes, 

    how angry I get when I'm cold, how twice I've accidentally maced myself, 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    and still you'd take me with you down into earth, give me more than my fair share of caterpillar
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> 
    Few believe we're in the middle of the end because ruin can happen as slowly as plaque blocking arteries,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    and only later feels as true as your hand resting on my hip,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    both of us quiet as roses waiting for the bees to arrive.
