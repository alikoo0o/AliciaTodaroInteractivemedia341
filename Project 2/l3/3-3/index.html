<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="3">The scientist on the radio said that humans <strong>will survive,</strong></marquee>
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="right" scrollamount="6">and at first I was buoyed, but she meant <strong>only some of us,</strong></marquee>
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="12">the ones living in <strong>tunnels,</strong> eating crickets to survive when the rest had died from <strong>mass starvation</strong></marquee>
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="right" scrollamount="20">after droughts lasted longer and <strong>seas rose faster</strong> and <strong>wars killed</strong> bigger </marquee>
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="3">because everyone wanted what little was left.</marquee>
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="right" scrollamount="6">I'd be fine with being one of the billions dead unless you were still alive.</marquee>
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="12">Under a down comforter or by a trash fire, <em> I want to be where you are.</em></marquee>

<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="right" scrollamount="6">how twice I've accidentally maced myself,</marquee>
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="12">and still you'd take me with you down into earth,</marquee>
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="right" scrollamount="20">give me more than my fair share of caterpillar.</marquee>
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="3">Few believe<strong> we're in the middle of the end</strong> because ruin can happen as slowly as plaque blocking arteries,</marquee>
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="right" scrollamount="6">and only later feels as true as your hand resting on my hip, </marquee>
<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="3">both of us quiet as roses waiting for the bees to arrive.</marquee>
