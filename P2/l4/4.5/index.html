    <p> The <span class="red"> scientist</span> on the radio said that <span class="red"> humans</span> will survive, and at first I was <span class="red"> buoyed,</span> 
        but she meant <span class="red"> only some</span> of us, the ones living in tunnels, eating crickets to survive when the rest had <span class="red"> died from mass starvation</span>
    after droughts lasted longer and seas rose faster and wars killed bigger because everyone wanted what <span class="red"> little was left.</span>
    I'd be <span class="red"> fine</span> with being one of the billions dead <span class="red"> unless you</span> were still alive. 
    Under a down comforter or by a trash fire, <span class="pink"> I want to be where you are.</span> 
    You know how poorly I dig holes, how angry I get when I'm cold, how <span class="red"> twice</span> I've accidentally maced myself,
     and still <span class="red"> you'd take me with you</span> down into earth, give me <span class="red"> more</span> than my fair share of caterpillar. 
    Few believe we're in the middle of <span class="red"> the end</span> because ruin can happen as slowly as plaque blocking arteries, 
    and only later <span class="red"> feels</span> as true as your <span class="red"> hand</span>  resting on my hip, both of us quiet 
    as roses <span class="red"> waiting</span> for the bees to arrive.
